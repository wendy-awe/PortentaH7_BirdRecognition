# PortentaH7_BirdRecognition
Bird sound detection project using Portenta H7 + STM32Cube-AI.
This project aims to implement a bird recognition system on the Portenta H7 microcontroller.  
It is developed using STM32CubeIDE and will include source code, documentation, models, and tests.

## Repository Structure
- `src/` : Source code for firmware and application
- `docs/` : Documentation, design notes, and reports
- `models/` : Machine learning models (trained or converted for MCU deployment)
- `tests/` : Unit tests, hardware tests, and validation scripts
  
### Week 1
- [x] Installed STM32CubeIDE
- [ ] Created Portenta H7 project
- [ ] Blink onboard LED confirmed
- [ ] UART "Hello World" working
- [ ] Push to GitHub repository
